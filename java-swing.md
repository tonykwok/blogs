I co-authored the book Filthy Rich Clients with Romain Guy. I also wrote the book Flex 4 Fun, about the graphical and animated side of Flex. You can see what I'm up to now on my blog Codedependent, where I post articles, demos, code, and videos on graphics, animation, and other geeky-fun topics. You can also check out the lighter side of my interests on my comedy blog at chetchat.blogspot.com, or in my book When I am King..., available from Amazon.com.)
