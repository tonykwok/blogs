(I worked as an architect in the Java Client Group at Sun, followed by a stint at Adobe on the Flex SDK team. I can now be found at Google, working on the Android SDK. I co-authored the book Filthy Rich Clients with Romain Guy. I also wrote the book Flex 4 Fun, about the graphical and animated side of Flex. You can see what I'm up to now on my blog Codedependent, where I post articles, demos, code, and videos on graphics, animation, and other geeky-fun topics. You can also check out the lighter side of my interests on my comedy blog at chetchat.blogspot.com, or in my book When I am King..., available from Amazon.com.)

(Chris Campbell is an engineer on the Java 2D Team at Sun Microsystems, working on OpenGL hardware acceleration and imaging related issues. He will be out the door as soon as his rock and roll career takes off. Anyone that knows Chris understands that he is full of contradictions and that his music career will never come to fruition. Therefore, you can trust that he will be working hard for years to come to make Java the perfect platform for rich graphical applications and games.)
